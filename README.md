## Files:

package.json: Think of it as a project information card. It lists all the tools and packages your project uses, like a shopping list for your project.


angular.json: This is like a project blueprint. It tells Angular how to build and configure your project, like setting up a construction plan for a house.


tsconfig.json: Imagine this as instructions for the TypeScript code in your project, like telling it how to translate your code into a language the web browser can understand.


src/index.html: This is the starting point of your website. It's like the first page of a book, and the web browser reads it first when someone visits your site.


src/main.ts: Think of this as the boss of your website. It's the first thing that starts when your site loads and tells other parts what to do.


src/app/app.module.ts: Imagine this as a manager for your website. It organizes all the pieces of your site, like pages, buttons, and forms.


src/app/app.component.ts: This is like the main character of your website. It's what people see first, and it controls how your site looks and behaves.

## Directories:

src/app/: This is like the storage room for all the parts of your website – pages, buttons, and more. It keeps things neat and organized.


src/environments/: Think of this as a special drawer for secrets, like passwords or settings that change depending on where your site is used.


src/styles/: This is where you put the clothes on your website. It's where you decide how your site should look, like choosing colors and fonts.


src/assets/: Imagine this as your website's treasure chest. It holds pictures, videos, and other things that you want to show on your site.


node_modules/: Think of this as a big library where you get tools and code for your project. It's like borrowing books from a library.


dist/: This is where you put the finished product. It's like packaging up your website to send it out to the world.


e2e/: Think of this as a group of testers who check if your website works correctly. They make sure everything runs smoothly.


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
